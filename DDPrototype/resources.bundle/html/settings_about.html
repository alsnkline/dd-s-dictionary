    <h1  align="center"> Dy-Di the <br /> Dyslexic's Dictionary </h1>   
    <p>I have had to work hard to manage my reading and writing challenges all my life and am now supporting my daughter as she starts  the same journey. I decided to create The Dyslexic’s Dictionary or Dy-Di (pronounced 'Dee Dee') to give those having difficulty spelling, a tool for independent discovery of an unknown spelling or a quick check of an uncertain one.</p>
    <p>Thank you to everyone who have clicked on the 'Give us your feedback' option and provided fantastic ideas and encouragement. I have been able to include a number of  suggestions and plan to add more.</p>

    <h2>Future enhancements </h2>        
    <p>Please keep your thougths and ideas for future enhancements flowing in. Here is an updated list of ideas:</p>
    <ul>            
        <li>The ability to add your own words</li>
        <li>Additional dictionaries, eg hard to spell words ideal for adult Dyslexic’s</li>
        <li>UK spellings and pronounciations</li>
        <li>The ability to favorite words</li>            
        <li>Showing groups of words with similar components</li>            
    </ul>
<p>
    Thank you - Alison
