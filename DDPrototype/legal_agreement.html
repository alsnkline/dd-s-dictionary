        Confidential Information, there may be no adequate remedy at law for any breach of its obligations hereunder, that any such breach or any unauthorized use or release of any Confidential Information may result in irreparable harm to the Licensor and therefore, that upon any such breach or any threat thereof, the Licensor shall be entitled to appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever remedies it might have at law.
